1) Open your terminal and open 2 different tabs.

4) On any tab, type "gcc main2.c -o main2" and press enter.

5) On one tab, type "./server". The server program should be running
   and listening for incomming conenctions.

6) On the other tab, type "./main2". The client program should be running
   and both client and server programs are communicating with each other.
